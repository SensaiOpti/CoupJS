# CoupJS

An entirely (well, 99%+) AI generated web version of the social deception card game Coup. Based on my love of [secrethitler.io](https://github.com/cozuya/secret-hitler).

Seriously, I know nothing about coding at all so enter at your own risk. I can promise there won't be any of those annoying emojis, though. Not once I purge them.

## Non-AI Stuff

There are a handful of items that are not AI generated. I've listed them below with extreme praise and thanks to their creator:

- In the default cards, I use a font called Pfeffer Mediæval, which was made by the lovely Dr. Pfeffer and can be found [here](https://robert-pfeffer.net/schriftarten/englisch/). It was used with admiration, appreciation, awe and respect for all that the good doctor does.
- In the anime card set, I use a font called [Lollipoptron](https://www.fontspace.com/lollipoptron-font-f29782) which was designed by heaven castro as a derivative of KineticPlasma Fonts' Hi. A mouthful!
- In the pixel card set, I use a font called [PixelMplus](https://fontmeme.com/fonts/pixelmplus-font/) by the heroic Itou Hiroki. A font that evokes a feeling of nostalgia.

### First Time Use / Administrators
The first created user account is an administrator...a super one! This super admin has access to special privileges. I **strongly advise** you, as the one hosting this, to create an admin user prior to allowing others to register. 

All admin users:
- Have access to the Admin Panel page, where they can see a list of users
- Can timeout and ban specific users. (Or undo any of these actions!)
- Can access moderation logs to see any recent actions performed by other admins.

Additionally, the super admin is able to promote users to be administrators.

Please note that administrators cannot be timed out nor banned. Be careful who you promote!
