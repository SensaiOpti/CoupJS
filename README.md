# CoupJS
An entirely (well, 99%+) AI generated web version of the social deception card game Coup. Based on my love of [secrethitler.io](https://github.com/cozuya/secret-hitler).

Similarly, this is built with NodeJS. And AI. So, so much AI.

To date, the only things *not* AI generated are the fonts:
- In the default cards, I use Pfeffer Mediæval, which was made by the lovely Dr. Pfeffer and can be found [here](https://robert-pfeffer.net/schriftarten/englisch/). It was used with admiration, appreciation, awe and respect for all that the good doctor does.
- In the anime set, I use Lollipoptron which was designed by heaven castro as a derivative of KineticPlasma Fonts' Hi. Anyways, you can find it [here](https://www.fontspace.com/lollipoptron-font-f29782).

(Seriously, I know nothing about coding at all so enter at your own risk. I can promise there won't be any of those annoying emojis, though. Not after the purge...which is yet to come.)
