Pixel art character portrait in the style of Final Fantasy Tactics (PlayStation, 1997). Bust-up portrait, facing slightly to the side, realistic proportions with a mature, serious expression. Hand-painted pixel art look with soft dithering, subtle color gradients, and strong directional lighting. Muted medieval fantasy color palette, detailed eyes, defined nose and jawline. Painterly shading rendered in pixels. High detail for pixel art, classic JRPG tactical RPG portrait. Soft, almost oil-painted look achieved through pixel dithering. Dark, moody lighting reminiscent of war-torn medieval fantasy.
