# CoupJS
An entirely (well, 99%+) AI generated web version of the social deception card game Coup. Based on my love of [secrethitler.io](https://github.com/cozuya/secret-hitler).

Similarly, this is built with NodeJS. And AI. So, so much AI.

To date, the only thing *not* AI generated is the font used, which is Pfeffer Mediæval, which was made by the lovely Dr. Pfeffer and can be found [here](https://robert-pfeffer.net/schriftarten/englisch/). It was used with admiration, appreciation, awe and respect for all that the good doctor does.

(Seriously, I know nothing about coding at all so enter at your own risk. I can promise there won't be any of those annoying emojis, though. Not after the purge.)
